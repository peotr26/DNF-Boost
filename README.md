# DNF-Boost

*This script has been moved to the [Fedora-Scripts](https://github.com/peotr26/Fedora-Scripts) repository.*

A script that boost DNF and help enabling certain features of DNF.

## Instructions:

Enter the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/peotr26/DNF-Boost
cd DNF-Boost
sudo bash DNF-Boost.sh
```

## More info:

The number of parallel downloads and making "Yes" the default are optional.

If accepted, the parallel downloads number is set to 10.

In my case `fastestmirror=True` does make a difference.
