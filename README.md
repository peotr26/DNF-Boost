# dnf-boost
A script that boost DNF and help enabling certain features of DNF.

## Instructions:

Enter the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/peotr26/dnf-boost
cd dnf-boost
sudo bash dnf-boost.sh
```

## More info:

The number of parallel downloads and making "Yes" the default are optional.

If accepted, the parallel downloads number is set to 10.

In my case `fastestmirror=True` does make a difference.
